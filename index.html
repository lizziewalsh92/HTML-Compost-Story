		<h1>Across New York City, Composting Is Now Mandatory—But Are There Enough Sites To Handle New York’s Food Waste?</h1>
		<p>By Lizzie Walsh</p>
		<h2>As of October 6, 2024, residents across the five boroughs will be required to separate their food waste from trash, but data shows that some Manhattan zip codes may not have enough bins for their residents</h2>
    
		<p> The onus is on property owners to provide composting bins to their tenants, but New Yorkers  <a href="https://cbcny.org/advocacy/testimony-state-new-york-city-recycling#:~:text=NYC%E2%80%99s%20recycling%20rates,fiscal%20year%202022." target="_blank">
		already only recycle about 17% of their total waste,</a>so expecting each property owner to provide these compost bins is unlikely. Thankfully, the city has a number of public compost 
		drop-off sites where tenants can compost while they wait—possibly forever—for their residential bin.</p>

		<p>Looking at only Manhattan data and comparing the number of compost drop-off sites in each zip code to the estimated 2024 population of that zip code, I found drastic differences 
			in compost site availability across the borough. </p>
		<p>Some neighborhoods only have one drop-off site in their zip code, while others have 250 sites—but this doesn’t always correlate to population size. If the city wants composting 
			to happen across the five boroughs, they’ll need to provide more public drop-off sites tailored to population size.
